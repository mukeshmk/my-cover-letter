Having completed my Masterâ€™s Degree in Computer Science and having 2+ years of experience as a Band-End \textbf{Java} {Engineer} working on Agile methodology and database management, gives me an edge. 
This will enable me to easily work with product managers, designers, engineers and other stalk holders.
{Though I worked with various Front-End UI libraries, the interpretation and modelling of data, the understanding of accessibility and security compliance, knowledge in database modelling, SQL queries and application design are a different story altogether.}
My experience provides me with an insight into critical thinking, decision-making, and analytical skills, and the confidence that I can provide decision-making solutions for the company.
