Having completed my Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science and Engineering, I am currently pursuing my Master’s Degree in Computer Science specialising in Data Science. I spent the past 2 years working as a Back-End developer in Agile methodology and database management.
{Though I worked with image and video processing, the interpretation of data, the correlation in numbers, algorithms, and business strategies are a different story altogether.}
My experience provided me with insight into critical thinking, decision-making, and analytical skills, and the confidence that I can provide decision-making solutions for the company.
